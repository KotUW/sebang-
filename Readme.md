# Introduction

Inspired by [unduck](https://unduck.link).

A minimal search redirector implementing DuckDuckGo's bang system.

## To Do:

- [x] Enhance `index.html`
- [x] Use go concurrency to make it faster and recover from error.
  By default, go does that.
- [ ] Implement user-defined bangs (potentially via cookies).
